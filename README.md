SpatialDE/CopyKAT/InferCNV/PHATE/scanpy


## SpatialDE
- New conda environment named as _spatialde_
- Install the environment in the terminal following the tutorial: https://github.com/Teichlab/SpatialDE
- Run the demo in the tutorial


## Scanpy
- Install the scanpy in the conda environment _spatialde_, I always have issue with classic conda install, so used mamba install instead
```
mamba install scanpy
```
